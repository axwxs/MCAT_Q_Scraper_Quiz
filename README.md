# MCAT_Q_Scraper_Quiz

Quiz yourself with randomly selected MCAT questions. This keeps track of your correct answers and the time you take while you answer questions with either A, B, C, or D. You can also use S to skip the question. Currently this only works with single paragraph questions which do not use images so occasionaly you may need to skip questions that rely on multiple paragraphs or images.
